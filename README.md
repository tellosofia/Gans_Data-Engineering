# Case Study: Optimizing Gans' Data Pipeline 🛴

## Background ℹ️
Gans is a startup developing an e-scooter-sharing system aspiring to operate in the world's most populous cities. Gans aims to optimize scooter availability by anticipating movement patterns, a task requiring sophisticated data collection and processing. 🌍📊

## Objectives 🎯
The project aims to create an automated data pipeline to predict e-scooter movements. Key questions include:
- How can data be collected effectively from external sources? 🌐🔍
- What database structure is needed to store this data? 🗄️
- How can the pipeline be automated and scaled using cloud services? ☁️⚙️

## Project Overview and Deliverables 📋
Creating an automated data pipeline involves two major phases:

### Local Pipeline – Phase 1
1. **Scrape Data from the Web:** Using Python's BeautifulSoup to download and extract HTML content. 🕸️🐍
2. **Collect Data with APIs:** Utilize Python’s requests library to authenticate and assemble API requests. 📡🔐
3. **Create a Database Model:** Define the logical structure of the database. 🏗️
4. **Store Data Locally:** Set up a MySQL database and store the collected data. 🛢️

### Cloud Pipeline – Phase 2
1. **Set up a Cloud Database:** Use AWS RDS to create a MySQL database in the cloud. ☁️🗃️
2. **Move Scripts to Lambda:** Transition data collection scripts to AWS Lambda functions. 📦🖥️
3. **Automate the Pipeline:** Use AWS CloudWatch Events / EventBridge to schedule and automate script execution. ⏰🤖

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️
- **Programming Languages:** Python 🐍
- **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup 🕸️
- **API Interaction:** requests library 📡
- **Database Management:** MySQL, AWS RDS 🗃️
- **Cloud Services:** AWS Lambda, AWS CloudWatch ☁️

## Expected Outcomes 📈
The project will result in an efficient data pipeline that collects and stores real-time data to predict e-scooter movements. This will help Gans improve scooter availability and operational efficiency. Key deliverables include a fully operational data pipeline and a Medium article detailing a subject covered during the project. 🎯📊
